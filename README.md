Project Goals for Project Simple Contact Book

	Contact Management: The main goal of this project is to create a user-friendly interface for managing contact information. Users should be able to add, edit, delete, and search for contacts easily.

	User-Friendly GUI: Provide a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library to make it simple and intuitive for users to interact with their contacts.

	Contact Storage: Implement functionality to store contact information persistently in a JSON file (contacts.json). This ensures that contacts are not lost when the application is closed and reopened.

	Add/Edit Contacts: Users should be able to add new contacts or edit existing ones. Data fields for each contact include name, phone number, and email address.

	Delete Contacts: Enable users to delete unwanted contacts, with a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions.

	Search Contacts: Allow users to search for contacts by name and display contact details if a match is found.

	List Display: Display the list of contacts in a user-friendly format within the GUI.

	Error Handling: Implement error handling and feedback to users, such as displaying error messages when a user makes an invalid input.

	Usability: Ensure that the application is user-friendly and easy to use, with clear labels and buttons for each operation.

	Documentation: Provide clear code comments to explain the purpose of each function, variable, and GUI element.

	Testing: Continuous testing is an integral part of our coding process. We validate the application's performance and error handling in real-time, covering scenarios like empty fields, contact not found, and successful updates.
